                Yes it does,for example if you wanted to adjust the font size of the browser in the settings all your fonts should scale up or down. This only works if you're using relative CSS units they are responsive. The browser font size adjustment won't have any effect on elements that use pixels.

            Im not sure about this one,but i think setting style to 200px doesn't consider relative root size it will just change to 200px no matter what.
